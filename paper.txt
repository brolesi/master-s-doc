Early identification of sepsis and septic shock in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) is crucial due to the high mortality rate associated with these conditions[1, 2]. Traditional methods often rely on machine learning models that use vital signs and lab test results to predict death risk, but the reliance on lab results can hinder real-time prediction [1, 2]. The complex nature of vital signs time series data, which are often sampled at irregular intervals and contain missing values, presents a significant challenge[2]. Recent research focuses on overcoming these challenges through advanced data analysis techniques and machine learning models to improve early prediction accuracy and enable timely intervention.
Machine Learning Models for Sepsis Prediction:
•
Transformer-based Models:
◦
PT3, a novel Transformer-based model, addresses the challenges of irregular time intervals and missing values in vital signs data by using a time-aware mechanism and an auto-imputing mechanism. It showed effective prediction performance on MIMIC-IV and eICU datasets[1, 3, 4]. PT3 uses a time decay function to explore temporal correlations and is pre-trained with a similarity prediction task to enhance representation learning [1, 4].
•
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs):
◦
Attention-based Bidirectional LSTM-CNN (AT-BiLSTM-CNN) architecture is designed for early sepsis prediction using electronic health records (EHRs) from ICUs. This model combines attention mechanisms, bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to analyze clinical time series data, demonstrating high accuracy and an AUROC of 0.88 when predicting 4 hours before sepsis onset [5, 6].
◦
Deep learning models have been developed to predict sepsis using time-series data, integrating clinical notes and continuous physiological features [7]. These models often employ modules like PTSM (Physiological Time Series Model) to encode physiological features over time [7].
•
Other Machine Learning Approaches:
◦
Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models have been developed using large-scale data from MIMIC-IV and eICU databases to predict mortality in sepsis patients, demonstrating high AUC values [8].
◦
InSight, a machine learning algorithm, utilizes vital signs, age, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), and pulse oximetry to predict sepsis onset [9, 10]. It has shown superior performance compared to expert scoring systems in hospital environments [9].
Time Series Analysis and Forecasting:
•
Vital Sign Forecasting: Deep learning models like N-BEATS, N-HiTS, and Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) are used to forecast vital signs, enabling early detection of physiological instability [11, 12]. These models predict future vital signs based on historical data, with the DILATE loss function enhancing the capture of temporal dynamics [11].
•
Time-Series Driven Models: Models based on CNN-Transformer and LSTM-Transformer architectures have shown substantial improvement over traditional recurrent neural networks for early sepsis prediction using time-series data [13].
•
STRAts model: is capable of time series forecasting, which allows it to assist a Sepsis-3-based check, and also able to dealing with sporadic clinical data through a novel triplet embedding module to avoid data imputation [7].
The Importance of Early Prediction and Intervention:
•
Early identification and intervention are paramount to improving patient outcomes and potentially prolonging patients’ lives [13, 14]. Early diagnosis and timely intervention in sepsis patients can significantly improve outcomes [15].
•
Mortality Reduction: The implementation of deep learning models like COMPOSER has been associated with significant reductions in mortality and increased compliance with sepsis bundle protocols [16].
•
Scoring Systems: Clinical scoring systems like SOFA, APACHE-II, and PIRO assist clinical practitioners in evaluating patients’ overall risk, although they are not specifically tailored to sepsis [14].
Challenges and Considerations:
•
Data Quality and Handling: Vital signs time series data are complex due to irregular sampling intervals and missing values [2]. Models must effectively handle these issues to provide accurate predictions [2].
•
Definition of Sepsis: Consistent application of sepsis definitions, such as Sepsis-3, is crucial for accurate model training and validation [17, 18].
•
Generalizability: Models must be validated on multiple datasets to ensure effectiveness across different clinical settings and patient populations [1, 3].

Abstract—Sepsis is a life-threatening systemic syndrome with a high mortality rate. It is critical for doctors to identify sepsis patients at high risk of death in real time, saving patients and reducing in-hospital mortality. However, current clinical methods use traditional machine learning models to predict the death risk of sepsis patients based on the vital signs and lab test results, which is difficult to achieve real-time prediction. In this work, we propose a novel Transformer-based model named PT3 to predict the death risk of sepsis patients within k hours (k = 6, 24, 48) in the future based only on the vital signs time series that can be collected in real time. In clinical settings, the collection intervals of vital signs time series are usually irregular. To address this challenge, we design a time-aware mechanism by using a time decay function to explore temporal correlations between records at different moments. We further introduce an auto-imputing mechanism to our model by using the masked prediction pre-training task. To enhance the representation learning ability, we propose a similarity prediction task, a self-supervised pre-training method, to pre-train our model with triplet-loss function. We validate the effectiveness of PT3 on two public clinical databases, MIMIC-IV and eICU. Experiments results show that our model has effective prediction performance, whose AUC on MIMIC-IV and eICU datasets achieve 0.9067 and 0.8733 respectively, especially in the next 6 hours, outperforming other state-of-the-art deep learning methods.

* Equal contribution
40% [6]. Due to the high mortality rate of sepsis, real-time identification of sepsis patients at high risk of death is critical for doctors to intervene in time to reduce in-hospital mortality.
Up to now, the clinical mainstream approach to predict the risk of death in sepsis patients is to use traditional machine learning models based on the vital signs and lab test results [7]–[13]. However, there are two main problems with these prevailing methods. First, these methods are difficult to predict in real time because they use lab test results, which need to be collected invasively and take some time to obtain available results after the blood draw. Second, these machine learning methods only use records of patient vital signs and lab test results at a single point in time, ignoring the time-series nature of vital signs data. To address these two issues, [14] proposed a model based on Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) that only processes time series data of vital signs to predict the risk of death in sepsis patients in the next few hours, making real-time prediction of sepsis death risk becomes possible. However, the modeling method in [14] has limitations, that is, the irregularly sampled vital signs records of patients are converted into time series with equal time intervals for further analysis, resulting in the destruction of the original information in the data. In addition, the missing values are simply filled manually, and the filled results may not correctly reflect the real state of the patient, which will have a negative impact on the model training process. In summary, vital signs time series are complex and difficult to handle because they are sampled at irregular intervals and contain a large number of missing values. This paper aims to address the challenging problem of processing patient vital signs time series data with irregular time intervals and missing values in order to improve the predictive performance of mortality risk in sepsis patients.

V. EXPERIMENTS
In this section, we first introduce the experimental settings and then analyze the experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of PT3.
A. Experimental setup
1) Datasets: We conduct experiments on two publicly available medical databases, MIMIC-IV and eICU. MIMIC-IV is a large single-center database that collects comprehensive information of patients admitted to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center from 2008 to 2019, including lab test results, drug use and vital signs time series. eICU is a multi-center database comprising heath record data from more than 200,000 ICU patients in United States between 2014 and 2015. These two databases have different structures and contents, and we screen out sepsis patient records to construct the experimental datasets. In our experiments, we train models on MIMIC-IV and evaluate models on both MIMIC-IV and eICU to verify the effectiveness and generalization of the proposed model.

VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
In our work, we propose a Transformer-based model, named PT3, that can simultaneously handle time series data with irregular time intervals and missing values. By introducing a time decay function, we design a time-aware mechanism for PT3 model, enabling it to explore temporal correlations between vital signs records at different moments. To enable the model to automatically impute missing values, we further design an auto-imputing mechanism for PT3, i.e., we pre-train the model by constructing a masked prediction task. In addition, to enhance the representation learning ability, we pre-train PT3 with a similarity prediction task, which is a self-supervised pre-training method. The experimental results on death risk prediction in sepsis patients show that PT3 has effective prediction performance, outperforming other state-of-the-art deep learning methods. Our future objective is to further broaden the application of the model to predict the risk of death in ICU patients in real time, not limited to sepsis patients.

Abstract Sepsis is a severe and expensive medical emergency that requires prompt identification in order to improve patient mortality. The objective of our research is to develop an attention-based bidirectional LSTM-CNN (AT-BiLSTM-CNN) hybrid archi-tecture for the early prediction of sepsis using electronic health records (EHRs) obtained from intensive care units (ICUs). We combine attention mechanism, bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) and convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyse clinical time series data, aiming to enhance prediction accuracy. The effectiveness of our model is measured using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC), utilising data from the 2019 PhysioNet Challenge. Upon assessing the performance of the AT-BiLSTM-CNN model throughout predic-tion windows of 4, 8, and 12h, we observed its exceptional performance in comparison with existing leading techniques. It achieved average AUROCs of 0.88, 0.85, and 0.84 for the predictions made 4, 8, and 12h before sepsis onset, respectively. This research contributes significantly to the development of smart clinical support systems, potentially offering lifesaving interventions for septic patients at critical moments.

2 Material andmethods
Figure1 illustrates the layout of the framework. It pro-cesses input data, which includes vital signs, laboratory test results, and demographic information. Initially, the frame-work undergoes a preprocessing phase, where it fills in any missing values and removes unsuitable records. Subse-quently, it employs a deep network block, featuring attention, bidirectional long short-term memory (LSTM), convolu-tional, and fully connected layers to predict the likelihood of sepsis development. The model then uses a predetermined reference threshold to determine if there is a suspicion of sepsis in the patient.

[7]Xu2023 early_prediction_of_sepsis_using_time_series_forecasting_01.pdf
Moving past the phase of simply modeling data, more recent studies seek to solve the problem in specific predictive tasks. In [10], it proposed a multi-modal learning solution to early sepsis prediction by integrating clinical notes and continuous physiological features to construct a transformer-based binary classification model. The deep learning architecture employs a PTSM (Physiological Time Series Model) module to encode physiological features over time, and a Clinical BERT [5] text embedding module to represent clinical notes. While the model in [10] achieved good performance on MIMIC-III [14] and eICU-CRD [15] datasets to predict a binary label indicating patient septic state based on observed data following admission into ICU, it functions simply as a binary classification model and is not capable of time-series forecasting. Additionally, the approach proposed in [10] simply deals with missing values in time-series data through imputation by forward and backward filling. Whereas, in [1], it proposed a two-step transformer-based approach to mortality prediction, including a regression model to forecast time-series values and a classification model to predict patient mortality. Compared to the model proposed in [10], STraTS [1] is not only capable of time series forecasting, which allows it to assist a Sepsis-3-based check, but also able to dealing with sporadic clinical data through a novel triplet embedding module to avoid data imputation commonly used in other methods such as in [10]. Thus in this work, we follow STraTS over other existing methods for both time-series forecasting to support our rule-based sepsis check, and directly use the classification model for sepsis prediction. However, it is worth noting that the original STraTS model represents a single-modal learning paradigm, i.e. it considers only physiological features and disregards information contained in clinical notes. Thus, in this work, we attempt to integrate a text embedding module to encode clinical notes and enable multi-modal learning.

Abstract Objectives: Sepsis is an infection-caused syndrome, that leads to life-threatening organ dam-age. We aim to develop machine learning models with large-scale data to predict sepsis patients’ mortality. Design: we extracted sepsis patients from two databases, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) as a train set and Philips eICU Collaborative Research Database as a test set. Setting: ICUs in multicenter hospitals in the USA during 2012--2019. Patients or participants: A total of 21,680 sepsis-3 patients are included in the study, in which, 3771 patients were dead and 17,909 survived during hospitalization, respectively. Interventions: No interventions. Main variables of interest: Basic information, examination items during hospitalization and some medication and treatment information are incorporated into analyzed. Seven different models were built with a Support vector machine, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest, Gra-dients Boosting, Multiple Layer Perception, Xgboost, light Gradients Boosting to predict dead or live during hospitalization. Results: Algorithms with an AUC value in the test set of the top three: light GBM, GBM, Xgboost. Considering the performance of the training set and the test set, the light GBM model performs best, and then the parameters of the model were adjusted, after that the AUC value was 0.99 in the train set, 0.96 in the test set, respectively. Conclusions: Models built with light GBM algorithm from real-world sepsis patients from electronic health records accurately predict whether sepsis patients are dead and can be incor-porated into clinical decision tools to enhance the prognosis of the patient and prevent adverse

their research, observing these waveforms can help in detect-ing sepsis within the first hour of a patient’s admission to the ICU [40]. Desautels et al. developed a specialised machine learning algorithm called InSight, which uses vital signs, age, Glasgow Coma Score (GCS), and pulse oximetry as input variables [13]. The efficacy of this approach was demon-strated by obtaining a 57% accuracy and an area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve of 0.74 in predicting the onset of sepsis four hours in advance. The InSight algorithm demonstrated superior performance com-pared to expert scoring systems in the prediction of sepsis in hospital environments. Horng et al. created a machine learn-ing model that utilised a linear support vector machine. They demonstrated the benefit of including free text data in addi-tion to vital signs and demographic information [22]. This method improves the provision of clinical guidance for sep-sis in emergency departments. In 2018, Mao et al. validated the InSight algorithm, which identifies and forecasts three crucial sepsis indicators (SIRS, SOFA, and MEWS) [37]. The researchers utilised data from four distinct institutions and employed transfer learning techniques to evaluate its extensive applicability. The algorithm integrated six essen-tial physiological indicators: respiratory rate, heart rate, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation, body temperature, diastolic blood pressure, and systolic blood pressure. The AISE algorithm, developed by Nemati et al., is specifically designed to accurately forecast the occurrence of sepsis at an early stage [41]. AISE integrates lower-resolution electronic health records (EHRs) with comprehensive data on blood pressure and heart rate. AISE has demonstrated a prediction accuracy of 63–67% and anAUROC score ranging from 0.83 to 0.85 when forecasting within a time frame of 4–12h in advance. Kamaleswaran et al. established that by analysing physiomarkers, artificial intelligence has the capability to forecast the occurrence of severe sepsis in critically ill chil-dren with a lead time of up to 8h [28]. Lyra et al. utilised an optimised random forest model to predict sepsis using imbalanced clinical data from ICUs, as a component of the PhysioNet Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2019 [6, 45].

Abstract—Sepsis and septic shock are a critical medical condi-tion affecting millions globally, with a substantial mortality rate. This paper uses state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) architectures to introduce a multi-step forecasting system to predict vital signs indicative of septic shock progression in Intensive Care Units (ICUs). Our approach utilizes a short window of historical vital sign data to forecast future physiological conditions. We introduce a DL-based vital sign forecasting system that predicts up to 3 hours of future vital signs from 6 hours of past data. We further adopt the DILATE loss function to capture better the shape and temporal dynamics of vital signs, which are critical for clinical decision-making. We compare three DL models, N-BEATS, N-HiTS, and Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), using the publicly available eICU Collaborative Research Database (eICU-CRD), highlighting their forecasting capabilities in a critical care setting. We evaluate the performance of our models using mean squared error (MSE) and dynamic time warping (DTW) metrics. Our findings show that while TFT excels in capturing overall trends, N-HiTS is superior in retaining short-term fluctuations within a predefined range. This paper demonstrates the potential of DL in transforming the monitoring systems in ICUs, potentially leading to significant improvements in patient care and outcomes by accurately forecasting vital signs to assist healthcare providers in detecting early signs of physiological instability and anticipating septic shock.

Abstract
Sepsis remains a critical concern in intensive care units due to its high mortality rate. Early identification and interven-tion are paramount to improving patient outcomes. In this study, we have proposed predictive models for early sepsis prediction based on time-series data, utilizing both CNN-Transformer and LSTM-Transformer architectures. By collect-ing time-series data from patients at 4, 8, and 12 h prior to sepsis diagnosis and subjecting it to various network mod-els for analysis and comparison. In contrast to traditional recurrent neural networks, our model exhibited a substantial improvement of approximately 20%. On average, our model demonstrated an accuracy of 0.964 (± 0.018), a precision of 0.956 (± 0.012), a recall of 0.967 (± 0.012), and an F1 score of 0.959 (± 0.014). Furthermore, by adjusting the time win-dow, it was observed that the Transformer-based model demonstrated exceptional predictive capabilities, particularly within the earlier time window (i.e., 12 h before onset), thus holding significant promise for early clinical diagnosis and intervention. Besides, we employed the SHAP algorithm to visualize the weight distribution of different features, enhancing the interpretability of our model and facilitating early clinical diagnosis and intervention.

outcomes, and ultimately prolonging patients’ lives. Currently, various clinical scoring systems, such as the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score [5], the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE-II) score [6], and the Predisposition, Insult/ Infection, Response, and Organ Dysfunction (PIRO) score [7], can assist clinical practitioners in evaluating patients’ overall risk and prognosis. Nonetheless, these scoring systems are designed for a broader range of criti-cally ill patients and are not specifically tailored to sepsis. To prevent the progression of severely infected patients into sepsis, pre-diagnosis and continuous monitoring of sepsis are of utmost importance, potentially leading to improved patient survival rates.

Discussion Machine learning is considered a promising approach for sepsis prediction in the ICU. The key to sepsis prevention is the early identification and treatment of the underlying causes of the inflammatory response. Early diagnosis and timely intervention in sepsis patients can significantly improve outcomes. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an accurate and efficient sepsis bedside early predic-tion tool. In this study, we constructed a model for early prediction of sepsis in ICU patients. By collecting time-series data from patients in the 4-h, 8-h, and 12-h peri-ods before sepsis diagnosis and inputting it into different network models for comparative analysis, we found that the time-series model based on the Transformer archi-tecture demonstrated outstanding predictive capabilities in an earlier time window (i.e., 12  h before onset). This finding provides an opportunity for earlier clinical inter-vention, which has the potential to result in significant enhancements in disease management and patient care. As the time window gradually shifts backward, tradi-tional recurrent neural network models also progres-sively exhibit performance improvements. This implies that in the later stages of disease progression, traditional

Sepsis remains a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Algorithms that assist with the early recognition of sepsis may improve outcomes, but relatively few studies have examined their impact on real-world patient outcomes. Our objective was to assess the impact of a deep-learning model (COMPOSER) for the early prediction of sepsis on patient outcomes. We completed a before-and-after quasi-experimental study at two distinct Emergency Departments (EDs) within the UC San Diego Health System. We included 6217 adult septic patients from 1/1/2021 through 4/30/2023. The exposure tested was a nurse-facing Best Practice Advisory (BPA) triggered by COMPOSER. In-hospital mortality, sepsis bundle compliance, 72-h change in sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score following sepsis onset, ICU-free days, and the number of ICU encounters were evaluated in the pre-intervention period (705 days) and the post-intervention period (145 days). The causal impact analysis was performed using a Bayesian structural time-series approach with confounder adjustments to assess the significance of the exposure at the 95% confidence level. The deployment of COMPOSER was significantly associated with a 1.9% absolute reduction (17% relative decrease) in in-hospital sepsis mortality (95% CI, 0.3%–3.5%), a 5.0% absolute increase (10% relative increase) in sepsis bundle compliance (95% CI, 2.4%–8.0%), and a 4% (95% CI, 1.1%–7.1%) reduction in 72-h SOFA change after sepsis onset in causal inference analysis. This study suggests that the deployment of COMPOSER for early prediction of sepsis was associated with a significant reduction in mortality and a significant increase in sepsis bundle compliance.

Patients and definitions
The screening process in this study employed the sepsis criteria established in 2016, known as Sepsis-3, to identify patients with sepsis. We initially chose patients who satisfied either of the following two conditions within a time frame ranging from 24 h prior to ICU admission to 24 h after: 1. By meticulously documenting infection-related diagnoses using the International Classification of Diseases, ninth revi-sion, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes, as provided by Angus et al. [19]; 2.Meeting the criteria for a suspected infection as outlined by Seymour CW et al. [20]. We then recognized subsequent organ malfunction as a sudden altera-tion in SOFA score of at least 2 points during the initial 24 h of being in the ICU. We only included the initial ICU

life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by dysregu-lated host response [3]. Different from those previous diagnostic criteria for sepsis, sepsis-3 highlighted the strong association between infection and organ failure according to the Third International Consensus Defini-tions for Sepsis and Septic Shock in February 2016 [2], hence, the early identification and diagnosis for sepsis are essential, which could provide meaningful information for clinicians to assess patients’ condition and improve survival outcomes through prompt and appropriate treatment. Due to the complex of vague sepsis syndrome definitions, unknown sources of infection and higher mortality, it is necessary to establish a reliable and effec-tive prognostic model for sepsis. With the help of these prognostic models, strong evidences for clinical deci-sion-making and rational allocation of public health care resources can be provided.
